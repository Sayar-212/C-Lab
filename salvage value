/*The method of computing the yearly depreciation of the value of an item is given by the
following equation:
𝐷𝑒𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 =(𝑃𝑢𝑟𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑒 𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒 − 𝑆𝑎𝑙𝑣𝑎𝑔𝑒 𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒)/𝑌𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑆𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑖𝑐𝑒
Write a program to determine the salvage value of an item when the purchase price, years
of service and the annual depreciation are given by the user. */
